For the longest time, I have wanted to write a blog. I have way too many ideas and thoughts knocking around in my head, and while I have a fairly good memory now, I know that eventually, more important things will start filling up that space, and I won't remember what I need to when I need to.

My problem with starting a blog, and dedicating myself to actually posting regularly is that I always get wrapped up with _HOW_ to start a blog. I get wrapped up with researching the best platform, thinking that I have to pick the best one, that will check all the boxes, and has all the features that I think I'll need... and then 6 months later I don't have a platform or any content, and I start the vicious cycle again.

This time I'm going to start a bit different, and focus more on the content, and figure out the platform as I go. I'm going to layout what I'm using, and as I go, I'll update this post to offer insights for what worked, and what didn't.

Writing content
- I often am working on something, or think "I need to write this down".  Part of the writing content is having things TO write about.  My first step is creating a list of topics I want to cover. That way I can check off things, keep regular content, and if I'm at a loss for something to write, then I have somewhere to go for inspiration. I'm going to start writing in Google Keep, because I use it today, and this will both help me have something that I have access to that I keep fairly up front, something I can access on all my devices, and some of the label and organization features that should hopefully make things easier to put works on screen.
- I'm still in the process of focusing on WHAT I want to blog about. I am primarily focused on blogging about information security topics, because that's what I'm passionate about. I may break out into several different blog posts, or work on tagging different things.

Once I figure out things, I'm sure things will end up coming up that will take my spare time, and content will be slow coming out.  Bear with me while I see if I can make this go actually happen.
